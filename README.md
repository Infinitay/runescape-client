# runescape-client
Reverse engineering project for Old School Runescape


This must be patched every OSRS revision change.

This is the dependency for UpdateMappings in https://github.com/zeruth/OSRS-Deobfuscator

Changes made here can be ran against same revision jars for refactored gamepacks in UpdateMappings, or it can be used as-is if client is cast to an Applet and added to a JFrame (Must set RSAppletStub then run setSize() and init() first.) 

Decompiled using FernFlower
